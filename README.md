## Programming for Data Analysis - Project 2018
### Simulating a real world phenomenon
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook with a simulation of voice traffic metrics for a Contact Center. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the benefits of simulated data analysis for the customer service sector. The Customer contact data is simulated using [Numpy random](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.1/reference/routines.random.html) distributions which can then be used to predict contact center key performance indicators and measure how change can affect performance against service level agreements.

Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. To run the notebook, you need to have [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) installed on your machine. It can be installed using the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) Python distribution. The notebook is called [Prog_Project.ipynb](./Prog_Project.ipynb).
